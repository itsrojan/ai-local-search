(Fall 2024 AI Assignment 2)
Pick one local search algorithm (Genetic Algorithm) to solve the Eight Queen problem.
The output should be a solution that looks like the following:
[3, 5, 7, 1, 6, 0, 2, 4].
Each element indicates the row position of the corresponding queen. For example the 5 in the array indicates that the queen on the second column is on the 5th row. Positions range from 0 - 7.
If no solution is found (Which is possible depending on your choice of algorithm and searching budget), output "No result found".
